            <h2>Identity</h2>
            <p>A Spoken Word Piece that communicates a Christian's ultimate worth and identity which is not found in having the highest position, salary, relationship/marital status, race or sexual orientation, but in being found and accepted by God on the
                basis of Christ's death to accomplish salvation (eternal life) and forgiveness for the believer (Ephesians 2:8-10, Titus 3:3-5).

            <h2>Dub Over Death</h2>
            <p>Poem that gives important insight in light of recent tragic events of 2018-2019, to offer hope towards the unasked question: What happens after we die? How do we conquer death? Why is there so much evil and suffering in this world? It is result
                of the brokenness and sinfulness of humanity, for rebelling against the Creator and desiring to be the ruler of their own life.</p>
            <p>The end result of all sin, leads to death. Whether slowly by disease, or whatever the case may be, there is a ripple effect of sin that leads to death. But God demonstrates His own love towards us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ
                died for us (Romans 5:8). He died so that we may live. And He rose again to offer us a living hope after death. He was seen my multiple eyewitnesses, transformed the heart of a former enemy of Christians to want to live for Jesus, and
                still is at work in restoring a broken humanity to Himself. It is a great reminder, for anyone who is suffering and fighting depression, to find the love, hope, peace and joy of knowing God and serving Him.</p>
